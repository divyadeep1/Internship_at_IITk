1.Pipeline for generating .ply file from given set of lines is ready:
	The '.json' files containing the coordinates of end points of lines along with their weights is to be put in './json/Make Walls'.
2.Pipeline for rendering files and taking their screenshot is also ready.
3.Backprojection module has been completed and tested.

1.I messed around with a couple of files, the old copy of them is saved in <filename>_old.py.
	For example I altered 'extruder.py', so the old one is kept in 'extruder_old.py'.
	However, the old file is used when the pipeline is being run.
2.Hypothesis - Thinning operation can be performed on original images, that would lead to better houg-line detection. Check 'thinning.py'.
3.Fixed a minor bug in 'face_maker.py' that caused incorrect addition of triads at the junction of multiple lines.
